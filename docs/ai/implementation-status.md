## Current Focus Areas

The development team is currently focused on:

1. Completing the certificate issuer component
2. Implementing the installation tracking system
3. Building out the authentication and authorization system
4. Developing the command-line interface
5. Beginning work on the database layer implementation

## Development Strategy

The project is following a modular development approach:

1. Core components are being developed independently with clear interfaces
2. Integration tests are being written alongside component development
3. Documentation is being maintained and updated as implementation progresses
4. Security is integrated into each component from the start
5. Regular code reviews ensure quality and adherence to design principles

## AI Development Assistance

Previous AI assistants have:

- Helped design the overall architecture
- Created comprehensive documentation, including architecture documents, admin
  guide, and user guide
- Assisted with technical design specifications
- Provided implementation recommendations for security features
- Helped develop test strategies and plans

Moving forward, AI assistance will be valuable for:

- Implementing specific components according to the technical design
- Optimizing performance for critical paths
- Enhancing security mechanisms
- Developing integration points with external systems
- Creating user interface components
