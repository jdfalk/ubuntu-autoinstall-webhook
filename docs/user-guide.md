## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. About This System

The Ubuntu Autoinstall Webhook system is a powerful tool designed to automate
the installation of Ubuntu systems through PXE (Preboot Execution Environment)
boot and cloud-init configurations. This system streamlines the process of
deploying Ubuntu across multiple machines, eliminating manual installation steps
and ensuring consistent configurations.

Whether you're managing a small lab environment or a large-scale data center,
this system provides the tools you need to efficiently deploy and manage Ubuntu
installations through a user-friendly web interface and robust API.

### 1.2. Key Features

  automatically via PXE boot
- **Customizable Templates**: Create and manage templates for different
  installation scenarios
- **Web-Based Management**: Easy-to-use web interface for managing systems and
  configurations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track installation progress and view logs in real
  time
- **Automatic System Discovery**: Detect new systems on the network through DHCP
  requests
- **Secure Communication**: Built-in certificate authority for secure
  client-server communication
- **API Access**: Comprehensive API for automation and integration with other
  systems
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for multi-user
  environments

### 1.3. System Requirements

To view a default template:

1. Navigate to "Templates" in the main menu
2. Click on the template name to view its details
3. Review the template configuration, including:

- Cloud-init user data
- Network configuration
- Storage layout
- Post-installation commands

### 4.2. Creating New Templates

To create a new installation template:

1. Navigate to "Templates" in the main menu
2. Click the "Create Template" button
3. Fill in the basic information:

- Template Name
- Description
- Ubuntu Version
- Base Template (if inheriting from another template)

4. Configure the installation parameters:

- Language and locale settings
- Timezone
- Keyboard layout

5. Configure system settings:

- Hostname pattern (can include variables)
- Domain name
- Network configuration

6. Configure storage layout:

- Partitioning scheme
- Volume management
- Mount points

7. Configure user accounts:

- Default username
- Authentication method (password, SSH key)
- Sudo permissions

8. Configure additional packages and repositories
9. Add post-installation commands if needed
10. Click "Save" to create the template

### 4.3. Template Variables

Templates support variables for dynamic configuration:

- `${hostname}`: System hostname
- `${mac}`: System MAC address
- `${ip}`: System IP address
- `${uuid}`: System UUID
- `${timestamp}`: Current timestamp
- `${random}`: Random string
- `${custom:field_name}`: Custom field from system metadata

Variables can be used in most template sections, including:

Example hostname pattern: `server-${mac:4:8}` (creates hostnames like
"server-DDEEFF12")

### 4.4. Template Inheritance

Templates can inherit from other templates to reduce duplication:

1. When creating a new template, select a base template
2. The new template inherits all settings from the base template
3. Any settings you modify override the inherited values
4. Sections left empty will use the values from the base template
5. This allows creating template hierarchies for different use cases

For example:

- Create a base "Standard Server" template with common settings
- Create "Web Server" template that inherits from "Standard Server" but adds web
  packages
- Create "Database Server" template that inherits from "Standard Server" but
  adds database packages

### 4.5. Managing Templates

## 6. Cloud-Init Configurations

### 6.1. Understanding Cloud-Init

Cloud-init is the industry standard for early initialization of cloud instances.
The Ubuntu Autoinstall Webhook system uses cloud-init to automate Ubuntu
installations with these key files:

- **user-data**: Contains most of the installation instructions
- **meta-data**: Provides instance metadata like hostname
- **network-config**: Defines network configuration

The templates in the system provide an interface to generate these cloud-init
files without needing to understand their raw format.

### 6.2. Basic Configuration

The basic cloud-init configuration includes:

- **Locale and Language**: System localization settings
- **Timezone**: System time zone
- **Keyboard Layout**: Keyboard configuration
- **Host Information**: Hostname and domain name
- **User Accounts**: Initial user creation and authentication

These settings can be configured in the "Basic Settings" section when creating
or editing a template.

### 6.3. Network Configuration

Network configuration options include:

- **DHCP**: Automatic IP address assignment
- **Static IP**: Manual IP configuration
  - IP address
  - Subnet mask
  - Gateway
  - DNS servers
- **VLAN**: Virtual LAN configuration
- **Bonding**: Network interface bonding
- **Bridge**: Network bridging

Configure these settings in the "Network" section of the template editor.

### 6.4. Storage Configuration

Storage configuration options include:

- **Automatic Partitioning**: Let the installer decide (uses LVM)
- **Simple Partitioning**: Basic partition layout (/, /boot, swap)
- **Custom Partitioning**: Define specific partitioning scheme
  - Partition sizes and mount points
  - Filesystem types
  - LVM configuration
  - Disk encryption
  - RAID configuration

Configure these settings in the "Storage" section of the template editor.

### 6.5. User Configuration

User configuration options include:

- **Default User**: Username and authentication method
  - Password authentication (password hash)
  - SSH key authentication
- **Password Policies**: Expiry and complexity
- **Sudo Access**: Configure sudo permissions
- **Additional Users**: Create multiple initial users

Configure these settings in the "Users" section of the template editor.

### 6.6. Post-Installation Tasks

You can configure tasks to run after installation:

- **Package Installation**: Install additional packages
- **Custom Scripts**: Run arbitrary commands or scripts
- **System Services**: Enable or disable services
- **System Updates**: Configure automatic updates
- **Reboot Policy**: Control post-installation reboot behavior

Configure these settings in the "Post-Install" section of the template editor.
