# Ubuntu Autoinstall Webhook - Overview Document

## **1. Introduction**

The Ubuntu Autoinstall Webhook is a system designed to automate the installation of Ubuntu on client machines via PXE boot and cloud-init. It dynamically manages iPXE configurations, tracks installation status, and ensures successful first-boot execution.

## **2. Key Features**

- **Automated Installation Flow**: Clients boot via PXE and receive dynamic cloud-init configurations.
- **Webhook for State Tracking**: Clients send logs, hardware details, and installation status updates.
- **Dynamic iPXE Boot Configuration**: Custom iPXE files ensure correct boot sequences.
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Detects failures and reconfigures clients for reinstallation if necessary.
- **Scalability & API Accessibility**: Allows admins to monitor and trigger installations remotely.

## **3. High-Level Workflow**

1. **PXE Boot & iPXE Execution**: Clients request an IP, download boot.ipxe, and load a custom configuration.

2. **Ubuntu Live Boot with Cloud-Init**: Cloud-init provisions the system and begins installation.

3. **Installation Process**: Ubuntu is installed onto NVMe storage, with logs and status updates sent to the webhook.

4. **First Boot & Final Configuration**: The webhook updates the iPXE file to point to a post-install cloud-init, which completes system setup.

5. **Completion & Monitoring**: The system is marked as successfully installed and available for use.

## **4. System Components**

- **PXE Boot Server**: Provides network boot support.
- **iPXE Configuration Server**: Hosts dynamic boot scripts.
- **Cloud-Init Configuration Server**: Serves cloud-init files per client.
- **Webhook API**: Handles logs, status tracking, and dynamic configuration updates.
- **Database**: Stores installation statuses, logs, and client metadata.

## **5. Deployment Considerations**

- Containerized deployment for flexibility.
- Load balancing for high availability.
- Authentication to ensure secure access.

## **6. Conclusion**

This document provides a high-level overview of the Ubuntu Autoinstall Webhook, detailing its architecture, features, and workflow. It serves as a reference for developers working on the project.
