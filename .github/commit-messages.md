# Conventional Commit Message Guidelines

## Template Structure

**IMPORTANT**: Only include issue numbers if you are working on a specific
GitHub issue. Do not use placeholder numbers like #123.

For commits that address multiple issues, use this multi-issue format:

```text
type(scope): primary description

Brief description of the overall changes and their purpose.

Issues Addressed:

type(scope): description
- path/to/file1.ext - Description of changes
- path/to/file2.ext - Description of changes
- path/to/file3.ext - Description of changes

type(scope): description
- path/to/file4.ext - Description of changes
- path/to/file5.ext - Description of changes

type(scope): description
- path/to/file6.ext - Description of changes
```

For single commits, use the standard format:

```text
type(scope): description

Brief description of what was changed and why.

Files changed:
- [path/to/file1.ext](path/to/file1.ext) - Description of changes
- [path/to/file2.ext](path/to/file2.ext) - Description of changes
```

Only if working on a specific issue, include the issue number:

```text
type(scope): description (#actual-issue-number)

Brief description of what was changed and why.

Files changed:
- [path/to/file1.ext](path/to/file1.ext) - Description of changes
- [path/to/file2.ext](path/to/file2.ext) - Description of changes

Closes #actual-issue-number
```

For commits without a specific issue, omit the issue number entirely:

```text
type(scope): description

Brief description of what was changed and why.

Files changed:
- path/to/file1.ext - Description of changes
- path/to/file2.ext - Description of changes
```

## Guidelines

### Commit Header

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Include issue number only if working on a specific issue:
  `type(scope): description (#issue-number)`
- Keep the header under 72 characters
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Be specific and descriptive

### Body Structure

- **Single Issue**: Use "Files changed:" section
- **Multiple Issues**: Use "Issues Addressed:" with subsections
- Group files by the issue they address
- Include brief context about the overall changes

### Conventional Commit Types

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, build changes, etc.
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits

### File Documentation

- **Always list every modified file**
- Explain what changed in each file, not just what the file does
- Use relative paths from repository root as markdown links:
  `[path/to/file.ext](path/to/file.ext)`
- Be specific about the nature of changes

### Issue References

- Include issue numbers in the header: `(#123)`
- Use closing keywords in footer: `Closes #123, #456`
- For related issues: `Related to #999`
- Omit issue references if not working on a specific issue

## Examples

### Multi-Issue Commit Example

```text
feat(auth): implement user authentication system (#123)

Added comprehensive authentication system with JWT tokens, profile management,
and updated documentation to support the new auth workflow.

Issues Addressed:

feat(auth): implement JWT token validation (#123)
- [src/middleware/auth.js](src/middleware/auth.js) - JWT validation logic and middleware
- [src/routes/api.js](src/routes/api.js) - Applied auth middleware to protected routes
- [tests/auth.test.js](tests/auth.test.js) - Comprehensive test coverage for auth flow

feat(ui): add user profile page (#456)
- [src/components/UserProfile.jsx](src/components/UserProfile.jsx) - Main profile component with edit functionality

```

### Single-Issue Commit Example

```text
fix(search): resolve pagination bug in results (#542)

Fixed issue where search results pagination was not properly handling
empty result sets, causing infinite loading states.

Files changed:
- [src/components/SearchResults.jsx](src/components/SearchResults.jsx) - Added null check for empty results
- [src/hooks/useSearchPagination.js](src/hooks/useSearchPagination.js) - Fixed pagination logic for edge cases
- [tests/search.test.js](tests/search.test.js) - Added test coverage for empty result pagination

Closes #542
```

### Simple Commit Example

```text
style(ui): format search component files

Applied prettier formatting to search-related components.

Files changed:
- [src/components/SearchBar.jsx](src/components/SearchBar.jsx) - Code formatting only
- [src/components/SearchResults.jsx](src/components/SearchResults.jsx) - Code formatting only
```

### Breaking Change Example

```text
feat(api)!: restructure user authentication endpoints (#345)

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication endpoints have been restructured.
The /auth/login endpoint now returns different response format.

Issues Addressed:

feat(api): restructure authentication endpoints (#345)
- [src/routes/auth.js](src/routes/auth.js) - New endpoint structure and response format
- [src/middleware/auth.js](src/middleware/auth.js) - Updated to handle new token format
- [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) - Updated API documentation

Closes #345
```

## Best Practices

### Do

1. **Be specific** - Explain what changed and why
2. **Group by issue** - Keep related changes together
3. **List all files** - Don't leave any modified files undocumented
4. **Use present tense** - "add" not "added"
5. **Reference issues only when working on specific issues** - Don't use
   placeholder numbers
6. **Be consistent** - Follow the format every time

### Don't

1. **Mix unrelated changes** - One commit per logical change set
2. **Use vague descriptions** - "fix stuff" or "update files"
3. **Forget file listings** - Every file should be documented
4. **Use placeholder issue numbers** - Only reference real issues you're working
   on
5. **Use past tense** - Avoid "fixed" or "added"

## Integration with VS Code

Your VS Code settings are configured to use these commit message guidelines.
When generating commit messages with GitHub Copilot, it will follow this format
automatically.

## Atomic Commits

- **One logical change per commit** - Don't mix features, fixes, and docs
- **Complete changes** - Don't split related files across commits
- **Buildable commits** - Each commit should leave the code in a working state
- **Issue-focused** - Group files by the issue they address, not by file type
