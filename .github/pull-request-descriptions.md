```

## Description Guidelines

- Keep it concise but informative (1-3 sentences)

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Avoid jargon unless necessary for technical clarity

## Motivation Section Guidelines

- Explain why changes were needed
- Reference business goals or user needs when appropriate
- Link to design documents or specifications when available
- Provide context for reviewers who may not be familiar with the problem

## Changes Section Guidelines

- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Be specific about what was changed
- Group related changes together
- Include both code changes and any workflow/process changes
- Highlight architectural decisions or tradeoffs made

## Testing Section Guidelines

- Describe how changes were tested (unit tests, integration tests, manual testing)
- Include test coverage information if available
- Note edge cases that were specifically tested
- Mention any testing tools or environments used

## Screenshots Guidelines

- Include before/after screenshots for UI changes

## Related Issues Guidelines

- Use the format: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, or `Related to #789`
- Link to all relevant issues/tickets
- If applicable, link to design documents or specifications

## Special Cases

- For breaking changes, include a "Breaking Changes" section with migration instructions

- For dependency updates, include rationale and any potential impacts

## Best Practices

- Keep the PR focused on a single feature or fix

- Tag appropriate reviewers based on areas of expertise
- Use the PR template provided by the repository when available

## Examples

```markdown
## Description
Add JWT authentication to the API endpoints

## Motivation
Our API currently uses basic authentication which doesn't meet security requirements for the new client portal.

## Changes
- Added JWT middleware to authenticate API requests
- Created token generation endpoint at `/api/auth/token`
- Updated user model to store refresh tokens
- Added environment variables for JWT secret and expiration

## Testing
- Added unit tests for token generation and validation
- Tested integration with frontend using Postman collection
- Verified token expiration and refresh flow

## Related Issues
Closes #234
Related to #156
