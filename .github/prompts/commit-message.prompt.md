# Commit Message Generation Prompt

Generate a conventional commit message for the staged changes. Use the following
guidelines:

- Reference the [commit message standards](../commit-messages.md).
- Summarize the changes clearly and concisely.
- Include a "Files changed:" section with a summary and markdown links for all
  modified files.
- Use imperative, present tense and do not end with a period.
