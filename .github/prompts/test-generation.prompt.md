# Test Generation Prompt

Generate comprehensive tests for the code in this workspace. Use the following
guidelines:

- Reference the
  [general coding instructions](../instructions/general-coding.instructions.md).
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Cover both happy paths and edge cases.
- Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies.
- Ensure tests are deterministic and independent.
- Use language-specific test conventions (see language instructions).
